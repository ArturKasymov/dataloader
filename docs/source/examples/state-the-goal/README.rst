Getting Started with Creating a Good Notebook
=============================================

For multi-stage notebooks (``01-xxx``, ``02-xxx``), provide a brief introduction like the following:

   The MovieLens25M is a popular dataset for recommender systems and is used in academic publications.
   Most users are familiar with the dataset and we will teach the basic concepts of Merlin:

   - Learn to use NVTabular for using GPU-accelerated feature engineering and data preprocessing.
   - Become familiar with the high-level API for NVTabular.
   - Use single-hot/multi-hot categorical input features with NVTabular.
   - Use the NVTabular dataloader with TensorFlow Keras model.
   - Use the NVTabular dataloader with PyTorch.
